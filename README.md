MJavascript
============

This code is by no means the definite guide to creating javascript code and all corrections and contributions are welcome.

As single page apps and large scale javascript applications become more prominent on the web, useful resources for those developers who are jumping the ship are crucial

This skeleton can serve as a starting point to building javascript applications.  It can also serve as a place to share our knowledge.


### Requirements 
We'll try and keep the requirements to a minimum.  We should also have them play nice with each other, so we shouldn't put anything in here that keep us form using jQuery.

* Backbone.js - [Docs](http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/)

### Features
